## Why This Matters

Bitcoin mining is necessary to maintain the ledger (blockchain). The miners of today have become extremely sophisticated and use high powered and complex hardware to solve the complex computational math problems required in the mining process. So with companies like Hut 8, and Hut 8’s competitors like HIVE Blockchain technologies and Stronghold digital mining competing to solve these problems, its keeping the blockchain ledger accurate and trustworthy for all to use   

## Why This May be Interesting

There has been huge opportunities for companies like Hut 8 to take advantage of more market share with the recent crypto currency ban in china (this includes mining) This made bitcoin easier to mine due to the fact that china had such a strong hold on the mining due to a number of economic factors (proximity to hardware cheap energy. “With so much hash rate turned off, Bitcoin’s difficulty lowered to make it easier to mine. Difficulty is an internal score that is algorithmically adjusted roughly every two weeks to make sure Bitcoin’s blocks are mined in target with a 10 minute average; if hash rate increases during a difficulty period, the difficulty raises, and if hash rate decreases, then difficulty decreases.”.

This has seen many North American and Canadian mining company’s ramp up. This can be seen in Hut 8’s share price, with a 52 week range starting at $0.62 with a recent high of $16.42
